                    <i>I'm quietly confident and always aiming to improve on my work.</i><Br><br>
                    Hi, my name is Nkau Yer Lor but you can simply call me Yer. I will be graduating 
                    this Spring 2021 with my Bachelor of Science in Human-Technology Interaction, minor 
                    in Business at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point. I began my journey with my 
                    first internship right on campus in June 2019, then transitioned to accepting an 
                    intern position at Herrschners a year later. I've enjoyed all the work that I've done 
                    whether it was building wireframes, maintaining sites, creating graphics, digging into 
                    the codes and modifying them, etc.
                    <br><br>
                    I chose this field because I admire the technology and design aspects. Technology 
                    has been evolving tremendously and there are always new designs, trends, techniques, and
                    that's what interests me about this field. To be able to keep up and learn all of these
                    is never enough because it's always growing. I want to take part in a developing and design field.
                    I specifically chose Human-Technology Interaction because with everything evolving, there 
                    are new ways to use new products, and being part of making a product easier for users to 
                    use is a way for me to give back.
                    <br><br>
                    What I'm excited about this career path are all the people I'll meet and techniques I'll learn. 
                    I think that it's incredible how other designers and developers go through the  many stages 
                    of planning, developing, and testing to get to the final end product. There is so 
                    much creativity and passion involved.
                    <br><br>
                    Aside from all of this, I enjoy doing many other things! I have a passion for playing 
                    volleyball and have placed in the top three two times at Hmong Volleyball Tournaments.
                    Volleyball helps me stay active and I enjoy meeting new players. I also enjoy hiking. 
                    This year, I made a goal for myself to enjoy nature more and hiking is the perfect way 
                    to achieve that goal! Lastly, once quarantine hit, I started doing digital illustrations 
                    and loved doing that! Check out some of my digital illstrations 
                    <a href="digital-illustrations.html">here </a>:) 
                    <br><br>
                    Positions that I am interested in range from UX/UI Designer to Web Design/Developer.
